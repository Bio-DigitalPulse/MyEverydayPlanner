# MyEverydayPlanner


This is a fully functional daily planner, which will shift colors depending on what time of day it is.

The embedded text area allows for user input, with ample space for a multitude of plans. 

This input is directly linked to localStorage that makes storing the data easy and convenient! 

The large save button with easily identifiable save icon, subtle depression animation to denote the button as active, and large print numbers are all beautifully simplistic additions to this scheduling calendar. 

All of this is to appeal to a wide variety of user utility.

Stackside, visiting programmers will find easily identifiable HTML, CSS and Javascript element. In proper semantic structure to allow for a common international compatability among developers wishing to make additional future changes.
